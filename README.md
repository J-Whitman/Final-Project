# Final-Project
This is where I am posting the code for my final project for LIS 4930.

This project creates a simplified version of the TTRPG "Dungeons and Dragons" where the user is able to create a character, select weapons, select a monster to fight, and then fight the monster.

This project has user inputs surrounded by while loops in order to ensure that the user inputs a value within the appropriate range for the given input, and that it is not a duplicate of another user input (where appropriate).

This code also has several nested if-else loops in order to split different values and paths that are determined by previous choices made by the user so that the appropriate action is taken when the current choice is made.

Current Issues with the code:
  The code currently can not handle blank inputs or string inputs and will end the program early if the user does input one of those types of inputs. I am currently unsure as to how I would be able to fix this issue, however I am open to suggestions.
