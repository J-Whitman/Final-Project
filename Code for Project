"""
This is a the final project for LIS 4930.
The goal of this project is to show that I am able to utilize different aspects of what I have
learned in this class in order to solve a problem.

In this project I will be creating a system of dice rolls based off of Dungeons and Dragons where the user will select what type of weapon is used, and then the characteristics of the weapon will be utilized in order to determine 1) To Hit, 2) Damage done. The user will also have the ability to 'roll stats' for their character (this will include all 6 base stats for a character, as well as using those stats to determine the other derived stats such as health and initiative), where each stat will determine different bonuses. The user will then be able to pick an enemy to fight, and will play a turn based game where after each action current stats are presented for both the user and the enemy.
